         all} the remote references are downloaded. This is useful
         when cloning a new repository as the remote references are

      {- If a reference (e.g. a [`Ref] {!want} value) appears in the
         list, the object corresponding to that remote reference are
         fetched. This works only if the server exports the
         "allow-reachable-sha1-in-want" (available in Git 2.5.0)}
      {- If a commit hash (e.g. a [`Commit] {!want} value) in the
         list, the objects corresponding to the that remote commits
         are fetched..}  }

      {b Note:} the local HEAD is not modified when doing a fetch. To do so
      (for instance when doing a clone) do the following:

      {[
        fetch t gri >>= fun r ->
        match Result.head_contents r with
        | Some h -> Store.write_head t h
